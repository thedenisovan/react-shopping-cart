# React Shopping Cart Project

üíª This project was built to level up my skills with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, API calls, and testing. It was my first experience with TypeScript, which felt challenging at first, but I quickly grew to appreciate its static typing and error prevention. I plan to continue using TypeScript in future large-scale projects.
